[UART]
baudrate = 9600             ; Baudrate for the UART interface, should work fine between 300 and 115200 baud

[Input]
useUsbKeyboard = 1          ; With this disabled, PiGFX will not load the uspi and look for a connected keyboard on any USB port
keyboardLayout = us         ; Keyboard layout to be used. These are supported: us, uk, it, fr, es, de, sg
sendCRLF = 0                ; With this enabled, the enter key on the connected keyboard will generate CRLF instead of LF only. CR has value 0x0D, LF has value 0x0A.
replaceLFwithCR = 0         ; With this enabled, the enter key sends CR instead of LF. You should disable the sendCRLF option if you use this, otherwise it will send 2*CR.
backspaceEcho = 0           ; Auto-echo the backspace char
skipBackspaceEcho = 0       ; Skip the next incoming character after a backspace from keyboard
swapDelWithBackspace = 1    ; Substitute DEL (0x7F) with BACKSPACE (0x08)

[General]
showRC2014Logo = 0          ; Show the RC2014 logo at startup
disableGfxDMA = 1           ; Disable fast DMA memory access for graphics (if 1)
disableCollision = 0        ; Disable sprite collision detection

[Filetransfer]
fileSendCharDelay = 10      ; Delay after sending one character [ms]
fileSendLineDelay = 100     ; Delay after sending one line [ms] (this is triggered by every CR or LF character)
